What's this then?
=================

Django Inlines is an app to let you use include other objects and special 
bits in your text fields.

It uses a registration style so it's easy to set up inlines for any of your apps
or third party applications.

Warning
=======

Django inlines is still alpha. Important bits don't exist yet. These include:

* A template tag to actually be able to use them.
* Documentation.
* Adding validation hooks to the base classes.
* A model field and a widget for validation and improved adding in the admin.
