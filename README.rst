What's this then?
=================

Django Inlines is an app to let you use include other objects and special 
bits in your text fields.

It uses a registration style so it's easy to set up inlines for any of your apps
or third party applications.

Django Inlines is tested and functional, but there is no documentation yet. 
The best examples of what it does are in the tests.
